			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong style="color: #515680;">In Fenway, how has the percentage of residential properties that were purchased by a corporate investor changed from 2004 to 2024? How does this rate compare with other areas in Greater Boston?</strong>
					<br><br>
					<b>Motivation:</b> My long-time family friends have lived in Fenway their entire lives, and we visited them every year for Thanksgiving. In 2016, they were forced to move from their single-family home to a condo due to rising rent prices. They believe these increases were driven by profit-seeking corporations that purchased nearby properties, contributing to rising housing costs. The move was particularly devastating for them, as their home held deep sentimental value—it was where they had raised their children.
					<br><br>
					The "<i>Homes for Profit</i>" article by the MAPC highlights a concerning trend: the rate of residential investor activity has steadily increased, rising from 16% in 2004 to 23% in 2018. This makes me wonder whether my family friends in Fenway experienced greater housing displacement compared to residents in other areas of Greater Boston. The MAPC article offered an analysis by housing submarket, but I am interested in Fenway in particular.

				<li><strong style="color: #515680;">What types of houses have been targeted for speculation by different types of corporate buyers (ie. banks, LLCs, LLPs, trust-like entities)?</strong>
					<br><br>
					<b>Motivation:</b>  The article <i>"When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord"</i> highlights private equity firms as the most aggressive corporate speculators, noting that the most aggressive funds aim for profits of 20% or more on investors’ contributions, minus management fees. In contrast, publicly traded real estate trusts yield a dividend of just 4.33%. Given this significant difference in profit expectations, I am curious whether there is also a meaningful difference in the types of homes targeted for speculation by these corporations. This question is important because different types of homes are purchased by people from different wealth brackets and socioeconomic groups, meaning corporate speculation could disproportionately impact certain communities.

				<li><strong style="color: #515680;">How do vacancy rates in Boston differ across wealth strata?</strong>
					<br><br>
					<b>Motivation:</b> In the Boston Globe article “<i>Reckoning with Boston’s Towers of Wealth</i>,” the authors paint a vivid picture of the city’s economic duality. They describe picnickers on the Christian Science Plaza lawn noticing that most windows of Four Seasons One Dalton are dark—a subtle yet striking hint that those who own the property may not be living there. In fact, the article mentions that only 16 percent of the units in the Four Seasons One Dalton have owners who claim them as their primary homes through a residential tax exemption. The implication is clear: many of these units are likely held for speculative profit rather than lived in. This stands in stark contrast to the everyday reality for many low-income residents, who are increasingly priced out of the housing market. Meanwhile, opulent amenities—like a wellness spa for “Very Important Pets”—signal a luxury lifestyle that is rapidly becoming the norm in certain parts of the city. Against this backdrop, we ask how the vacancy rates in Boston vary across different wealth strata.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			<b>Our first question</b> concerns the percentage of residential properties that were purchased by corporate 
			investors in Fenway (from 2004 to 2024). We will use the following dataset for our analysis: <i>Change Over 
			Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</i>. This dataset
			contains information on the percentage of residential properties that were purchased by corporate investors, by year and neighborhood.
			It is important to note a flag raised in the metadata section of the dataset: they determine corporate ownership
			based on keyphrase matching on the 'owner name' field. This introduces some level of "fuzziness" because of potential
			misclassifications (ie. a residential owner files under a corporation).
			<br><br>
			Before grouping our data by neighborhood, we will begin with a sanity check. Is it true that (average) corporate ownership has increased
			from 2004 to 2024? We will plot the average corporate ownership rate (averaged over all neighborhoods) over time to confirm this trend.

			<figure style="overflow: auto; text-align: left;">
				<img src="A2_2.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				Average corporate ownership rates steadily increase from 2004 (5.48%) to 2024 (25.29%). To calculate this average, each neighborhood and year was given equal weight. 
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the following dataset: <i>Change Over Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</i>.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We find that indeed, corporate ownership rates steadily increase over our desired time frame. We see that 
			rates almost monotonically increased from 5.48% in 2004 to 25.29% in 2024. This is in line with our initial assumption. Now,
			we are ready to move on to our main question: how does Fenway compare to other areas in Greater Boston? 
			<br><br>
			To facilitate the ease of our analysis, we will group our data by neighborhood and year. We will then plot the corporate ownership rates for Fenway and other
			areas in Greater Boston over time. By preserving the structure of the previous figure (including axes and data dimensions) and altering only the data grouping, we make it easy for readers to compare the aggregated and grouped results between Figure 1 and Figure 2.
			

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_3.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				This figure shows how average corporate ownership rates (grouped by neighborhood) change from 2004 to 2024. We highlight the trend of Fenway in green and the trends
				of all other considered neighbhoods in grey. The corporate ownership rates in Fenway are consistently higher than the average corporate ownership rates across all neighborhoods.
				Note that a random half of the original neighborhoods were removed from this figure to reduce clutter. We ensured that no removed neighbhorhood had consistently higher average corporate ownership rates
				than Fenway.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the following dataset: <i>Change Over Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</i>.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			The results demonstrate a clear trend. The corporate ownership rates in Fenway (9.00% in 2004 to 36.00% in 2024) are consistently higher than the average corporate ownership rates across 
			all neighborhoods. This is illustrated by the height of the green line (which corresponds to Fenway) relative to the grey lines (which correspond to each of the other neighborhoods).
			This suggests that Fenway residents may have experienced greater housing displacement compared to 
			residents in other areas of Greater Boston. This is in line with the concerns raised by my family friends, who 
			believe that rising rent prices in Fenway were driven by profit-seeking corporations. The results of our analysis 
			provide quantitative support for their anecdotal observations.
			<br><br>
			As my family friends are immigrants from Slovenia and Cyprus, this analysis raised another question: how did the demographic
			breakup of Fenway change over the years? Consulting the same dataset, we created pie charts to visualize the demographic breakdown of Fenway 
			in three equally-spaced years: 2004, 2014, and 2024. Our result surprised us, indicating an error in our assumptions about the dataset.

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_4.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				Pie charts demonstrate the demographic breakdown of Fenway in 2004, 2014, and 2024. These pie charts reveal a 
				strange finding: all of the population values by demographic group were equal across the years.
				This raised a red flag that our analysis may be incorrect. After consulting the metadata section of 
				the dataset, we noticed the root of our error: the demographic information
				in our dataset was for the year 2020, despite the fact that this demographic information was 
				included separately for each year. Note that the following information is missing from the pie-chart: the
				hispanic population size was 3,643 in each year (it was omitted to reduce clutter).
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the following dataset: <i>Change Over Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</i>.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			As stated in the figure caption, this analysis revealed an incorrect assumption that we made. 
			Each pie chart (for 2004, 2014, and 2024) was identical, suggesting the very unlikely 
			possibility that demographic breakdown of Fenway remained consistent across the years. 
			This raised a red flag that our initial assumptions about the dataset may be incorrect. After consulting the metadata 
			section of the dataset, we noticed the root of our error: the demographic information in 
			our dataset was for the year 2020, despite the fact that this demographic information was 
			included separately for each year. This error highlights the importance of carefully 
			reading the metadata section of a dataset before proceeding with analysis.
			<br><br>
			As a result, we were unable to answer our original question about how the demographic breakdown of Fenway
			changed over the years. However, we were able to pivot our analysis and ask a different question:
			in the year of 2020, how did the demographic breakdown of Fenway compare to other areas in Greater Boston?


			<figure>
				<img src="A2_5.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				This figure plots the demographic breakdown of Fenway and six random other neighborhoods from the Greater
				Boston area in 2020. In Fenway, shown in the middle of the figure, the white population is the largest demographic group, followed by the AAPI population.
				Allston, Downtown, North End, and South Boston were all predominantly white, while Chinatown was primarily AAPI, and Mattapan was primarily black.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the following dataset: <i>Change Over Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</i>.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Our analysis revealed that in Fenway, the white population was the largest demographic group, followed by the AAPI 
			population. This is in line with the demographic breakdown of 
			Allston, Downtown, North End, and South Boston. In contrast, Chinatown was primarily AAPI
			and Mattapan was primarily black. This analysis provides a snapshot of the demographic makeup of Fenway and other
			 neighborhoods in Greater Boston in the year 2020. It is important to note that <i>given the constraints of the dataset</i>, this analysis is limited to the
			 year 2020 and does not capture changes in the demographic breakdown over time.	

			<br><br>
			We conclude that while Fenway has a higher rate of corporate ownership compared to other areas in Greater Boston, it is 
			not the case that Fenway is disproportionately populated with minority residents. However, our analysis does not
			eliminate the possibility that corporate ownership in Fenway has disproportionately impacted the minority residents
			within the Fenway neighborhood. This is an important area for future research.

			<br>
			<br>
			<hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgb(244, 221, 224);"><br>
			<b>Our second question</b> concerns the types of houses targeted for speculation by different types of corporate buyers. 
			We will use the EDA Residential dataset for our analysis because for each residence,
			it included information about the type of corporate buyer and the type of property purchased. It is important
			to note that while carefully reading the metadata section of the dataset and taking a high-level look at the 
			dataset values themselves, we noticed the following: there is not an equal amount of information available
			for each residence. There are varying numbers of entries in the dataset that are associated with each residence
			and each entry corresponds to different years. This means that in the forthcoming analysis, we took effort to 
			carefully consider how to aggregate our data to ensure that we are not misrepresenting it.

			<br><br>
			Again, we begin with sanity checks and summary statistics about our dataset. First, we ask the following question:
			where are most of the properties in our dataset located? What does the distribution of properties look like across
			different neighborhoods?

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_6.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				When we plot the distribution of properties across different neighborhoods, we found that some datapoints
				(associated with properties in the Greater Boston area) were located just off of the coast of Africa. Upon
				closer inspection, it became obvious why: the latitude and longitude values for these properties were incorrectly
				set to 0.0. This error was likely due to a data entry mistake.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the <i>EDA Residential</i> dataset.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			As explained in the figure caption, we found that some datapoints (associated with properties in the Greater Boston area)
			were associated with (incorrect) latitude and longitude values of 0.0. This error was likely due to a data entry mistake,
			so we omitted these datapoints from our analysis. After omitting these datapoints, we were able to proceed with our analysis.

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_7.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				This heatmap overlays the distribution of properties in our dataset over a map of Greater Boston. The heatmap reveals
				that the data is concentrated in Boston (not surrounding cities like Cambridge or Somerville). Moreover, we see that
				the data is highly concentrated in four regions of Boston: the North End, Beacon Hill, Back Bay, and the South End.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the <i>EDA Residential</i> dataset.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			After we omitted the faulty datapoints from our analysis, our heatmap reveals that most of the remaining data is concentrated in four regions of Boston (the North End, Beacon Hill, Back Bay, and the South End). 
			We also see that the data is concentrated in Boston itself, rather than surrounding cities like 
			Cambridge or Somerville. 
			
			<br><br>
			Next, we conduct another univariate summary: what is the distribution of the type of 
			house represented in the dataset? To answer this question, we had to conduct an inner join of our EDA Residential
			dataset with the Usecodes dataset (provided in the same metadata Google Sheet as the EDA Residential dataset).
			This was necessary because the Usecodes dataset contained information about the type of property (ie. single-family home,
			condo, etc.) that was only present in the EDA Residential dataset by code number.

			<br><br>

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_8.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				We examine the distribution of the residential property usage by distinct residential
				properties in our dataset. We find that condominiums are the most commonly represented 
				type of house in the dataset, by a factor of more than 20. They are followed by 
				1-family residences and 4-8 unit apartment buildings. This figure filters out all usage types
				for which there were fewer than 100 distinct residential properties in the dataset.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the <i>EDA Residential</i> and <i>Usecodes</i> datasets.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We find that condominiums represented the most number of distinct residences in our dataset (by a factor of more than 20), followed by 1-family residences and 4-8 unit apartment buildings.
			After completing this univariate analysis, we were ready to move on to our main question: what types of houses have been targeted for speculation by different types of corporate buyers?

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_11.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				We show the number of properties purchased by different types of buyers (trusts, banks, government, etc.) acorss each of the property usage categories. LLC buyers show the most diversity
				in the types of properties they purchase, while government buyers show the least diversity. We measure diversity by the concentration of purchases in a single property usage category (independently calculated
				for this figure). We also see that all buyer types primarilty puchase condominiums, with the exception of government buyers, who primarily purchase educational residences.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the <i>EDA Residential</i> and <i>Usecodes</i> datasets.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			This answers our second question: what types of houses have been targeted for speculation by different types of corporate buyers? Regardless of the type of buyer, condominiums were, by far,
			the most commonly purchased type of property. This was true for all buyer types except government buyers, who primarily purchased educational residences. We find that LLC buyers show the most diversity in the types 
			of properties they purchase, while government buyers show the least diversity. All buyer types primarily purchase condominiums, with the exception of government buyers, who primarily purchase 
			educational residences. This analysis provides insight into the types of houses targeted for speculation by different types of corporate buyers. It is important to note that this analysis is 
			limited to the data available in the EDA Residential dataset and may not be representative of all corporate property purchases in Greater Boston.

			<br><br>
			This analysis raised another question: what were the most expensive purchases by LLC buyers? When did those purchases occur? Again, we consulted the <i>EDA Residential</i> dataset to answer this question.

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_12.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				This figure shows the largest residential purchases that were made by Non-Small LLCs. The size of each bubble corresponds to the price of the purchase, and the color of each bubble corresponds to the address 
				of the purchase. We see that the largest purchases exceed 500,000,000 dollars and were spread out between 2004 and 2020. The most expensive purchase was made in 2006, at 1 Lincoln St, for 889,000,000. Note 
				that this figure filters out purchases under 5 million dollars.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the <i>EDA Residential</i> datasets.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We see that the largest purchases made by Non-Small LLCs exceeded 500,000,000 dollars and were spread out between 2004 and 2020. The most expensive purchase was made in 2006, at 1 Lincoln St, for 889,000,000 dollars.
			This analysis sparked the following curiosity: what do these properties look like? Did their appearance change before and after the purchase?

			<br><br>
			
			To answer this question, it was necessary to turn to an image-based dataset.
			We consulted Google Maps Street View to find images of the two properties with the most expensive purchases in the year before and the year after the purchase. However, <i>we ran into an issue</i> when trying to conduct
			this analysis. One of the properties of interest– 1 Lincoln St.— was purchased in 2004 and 2006. However, Google Maps Street View only had images of the property from 2007 onwards. This meant that we were unable to
			compare the appearance of the property before and after the purchase. This limitation highlights the importance of carefully considering the availability of data before proceeding with an analysis. In response, we 
			decided to qualitatively look at images of the properties that were spaced between 2007 (the first available photographs on Google Maps Street View) and 2024 (the last available photographs on Google Maps Street View). 
			For the other property that we considered— 100 Summer St— this range included the date of the large purchase that we see in our dataset (2019).


			<figure>
				<img src="A2_13.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				We see images of two properties— 1 Lincoln Street and 100 Summer Street— in the years 2007, 2014, and 2024. These properties were associated with the largest purchases made by Non-Small LLCs in the <i>EDA Residential</i> dataset.
				We see that the appearance of the properties did not change significantly before and after the purchase. This suggests that the properties were likely not purchased for development or renovation.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from Google Maps Street View.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We found that the appearance of the properties did not change significantly before and after the purchase. This suggests that the properties were likely purchased for speculative purposes rather than for development or renovation.
			While this analysis did not provide a definitive answer to our question, it offers a qualitative perspective on the appearance of the properties before and after the purchase. This analysis is limited by the availability of data on Google Maps Street View and may not be representative of all properties purchased by Non-Small LLCs in Greater Boston.

			<br>
			<br>
			<hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgb(244, 221, 224);"><br>
			<b>Our third question</b> concerns how vacancy rates in Boston differ across wealth strata. We will use the EDA Residential dataset for our analysis because it contains the most information about each buyer.
			This question is difficult to directly answer. As mentioned in the Boston Globe article, the vacancy rates in Boston are not directly available. However, we can still explore this question by considering 
			variables that may serve as proxies (educated guesses) for vacancy rates. For example, if there is an individual with many properties associated with their name, it is likely that they are not living in all of them.

			<br><br>
			To begin to answer this question, we start with univariate analyses. In particular, we are interested in the distribution of the number of properties at each price associated with each individual, non-corporate buyer. We take the 
			same approach to identifying non-corporate buyers as indicated in the metadata section of the <i>Census and Corporate Ownership and Occupancy Over Time</i> dataset: look for sellers that don't fall into the categories 
			associated with corporate buyers (ie. LLC, LLP, etc.). We note, as is noted in the metadata section of the dataset, that this approach is not perfect and may misclassify some non-corporate buyers as corporate buyers. First,
			we filtered out all residencies where the buyer was an LLC, business, trust, bank, GSE, or government entity. We then plotted the distribution of the number of properties associated with each individual buyer.

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_15.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				We examine the distribution of the number of unique properties in the dataset associated with non-corporate buyers, binning by price range of the property in increments of 200,000 dollars. We find that the resultant histogram
				is right-skewed, with most properties associated with the purchasing price between 200K and 2,200K. The long tail of the histogram suggests that there are a few individuals who buy very expensive properties.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the <i>EDA Residential</i> dataset.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We find that the distribution of the number of unique properties in the dataset <i>for non-corporate buyers</i> is right-skewed, with most properties associated with the purchasing price between 200K and 2,200K. 
			The long tail of the histogram suggests that there are a few individuals who buy very expensive properties. This is in line with the assumptions that we made about the dataset. Now, we want to examine a univariate summary 
			of the distribution of the the number of properties owned by each of the non-corporate buyers that we examine.

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_16.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				In this univariate summary, most non-corporate owners <i>who own any property</i> are shown to only own a single property (17,635 owners), followed closely by owners who own two properties (4,437 owners). We find that
				a large portion of our examined owners do not own any property at all. We had previous assumed that every buyer in the dataset would own at least one property (as a product of buying that property). As a result, this analysis
				challenged the assumptions that we made about the dataset.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the <i>EDA Residential</i> dataset.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We find, as expected, that the number of owners who own any property is right-skewed, with most owners owning only a single property. However, as stated in the figure caption, we saw that a large portion of our examined owners do not own any property at all. This challenged the assumptions that we made about the dataset. We had previously assumed that every buyer in the dataset would own at least one property (as a product of buying that property).
			As a result, the forthcoming analyses are limited to entities that own at least one property in the dataset.

			<br><br>
			Now, we can proceed to answer our original question. In particular, we want to examine the owner vacancy rates between owners of different wealth strata. We use number of properties owned as a proxy for vacancy rates, assuming that owners with more properties are less likely to live in all of them.
			We also use the purchasing price of the property as a proxy for wealth, assuming that more expensive properties are owned by wealthier individuals. In the following figure, we plot the distribution of the 
			number of properties owned by each non-corporate buyer for buyers in each wealth stratum.

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_17.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				This figure shows the distribution of the number of properties owned for non-corporate buyers in each wealth stratum (where we use the price of the purchased property as a proxy for wealth stratum). In this analysis,
				we bin wealth stata by properties within ranges of 500K dollars. We find that the number of non-corporate buyers who only own any single number of properties does not vary significantly across wealth strata.
				This is indicated by the relative consistency of colored wedges in the figure. We note that it appears that owners within the wealth stata of 3500K to 5000K seem to own slightly more properties (an untick in the number of
				owners who own 2 properties and 3 properties) than other groups.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the <i>EDA Residential</i> dataset.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We showed that the number of non-corporate buyers who only own any single number of properties does not vary significantly across wealth strata. This is indicated by the relative consistency of colored wedges in the figure. We note that it appears that owners within the wealth strata of 3500K to 5000K seem to own slightly more properties.
			As we used number of properties as a proxy for vacancy rates, our findings for this question are inconclusive.

			<br><br>
			However, this analysis raised a follow-up question: of the non-corporate buyers who own only a single property, where are such properties located in Boston? To answer this question,
			we again considered the EDA Residential dataset. After filtering out all corporate buyers and all buyers who owned more than one property, we created a heatmap to show where the remaining properties were located in the Boston area. 

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_18.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				Here, we plot the density of non-corporate, single-property owners in the Boston area. We find that the properties are primarily located in the South End (in greater concentration that we see with our full-population 
				analysis in Figure 6). Compared to Figure 6 (the entire population), fewer owners are concentrated in Back Bay.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>We examined three facets of Boston’s housing market by exploring different aspects of our dataset.</p>
			<p>First, we examined the trajectory of corporate ownership in Fenway from 2004 to 2024. Our analysis 
				confirmed that corporate ownership (on average) across Boston increased steadily—from an average 
				of 5.48% in 2004 to 25.29% in 2024—while Fenway consistently exhibited significantly higher 
				rates, rising from 9.00% in 2004 to 36.00% in 2024. These findings support our hypothesis (and anecdotal evidence!) that 
				profit-driven real estate activities may be contributing to greater housing displacement in 
				Fenway compared to other neighborhoods. Our analysis of the demographic breakdown of Fenway
				in 2020 showed that the population was mostly white, although we note that this does not 
				eliminate the possibility that the minority residents were most affected by increases in the rate
				of corporate ownership. Such an analysis would require more longitudinal data about Fenway, which
				was outside of the single-year scope of our census dataset.
			</p>

			<p> Second, we investigated the types of homes targeted for speculation by different types of corporate buyers.
				First, we filtered out data entries that were associated with faulty values (latitude and longitude values of 0.00).
				We used a heatmap to confirm that the remaining data is situated within Boston. In particular, the data is concentrated
				in the North End, Beacon Hill, Back Bay, and the South End. Across nearly all buyer types, condominiums
				overwhelmingly dominate the market. LLC buyers exhibit the greatest diversity in property types, indicating a broader
				investment strategy than other types of buyers. We conducted a qualitative analysis of the highest-valued purchases by non-Small LLCs,
				finding that such purchases corresponded to skyscrapers whose appearances remained largely unchanged over the years. </p>

			<p> Third, we analyzed how vacancy rates in Boston differ across wealth strata.</p>

			<p>In conclusion, this work analyzes how profit-driven real estate transforms communities in the Greater Boston area. Thank you for reading!</p>
