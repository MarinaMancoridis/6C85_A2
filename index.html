			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong style="color: #441869;"><u>Question 1</u>: In Somerville, how has the percentage of residential properties that were purchased by a corporate investor changed from 2004to 2024? How does this rate compare with other areas in Greater Boston?</strong>
					<br><br>
					<b>Motivation:</b> My long-time family friends have lived in Somerville their entire lives, and we visited them every year for Thanksgiving. In 2016, they were forced to move from their single-family home to a condo due to rising rent prices. They believe these increases were driven by profit-seeking corporations that purchased nearby properties, contributing to rising housing costs. The move was particularly devastating for them, as their home held deep sentimental value—it was where they had raised their children.
					<br><br>
					The "<i>Homes for Profit</i>" article by the MAPC highlights a concerning trend: the rate of residential investor activity has steadily increased, rising from 16% in 2004 to 23% in 2018. This makes me wonder whether my family friends in Somerville experienced greater housing displacement compared to residents in other areas of Greater Boston. The MAPC article offered an analysis by housing submarket, but I am interested in Somerville in particular. I find this question especially interesting given that my family friends are immigrants from Slovenia and Cyprus, and Somerville is known for its diverse and international population.

				<li><strong style="color: #441869;"><u>Question 2</u>: </b>What types of houses have been targeted for speculation by different types of corporate sellers (ie. banks, LLCs, LLPs, trust-like entities)?</strong>
					<br><br>
					<b>Motivation:</b>  The article <i>"When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord"</i> highlights private equity firms as the most aggressive corporate speculators, noting that the most aggressive funds aim for profits of 20% or more on investors’ contributions, minus management fees. In contrast, publicly traded real estate trusts yield a dividend of just 4.33%. Given this significant difference in profit expectations, I am curious whether there is also a meaningful difference in the types of homes targeted for speculation by these corporations. This question is important because different types of homes are purchased by people from different wealth brackets and socioeconomic groups, meaning corporate speculation could disproportionately impact certain communities.

				<li><strong style="color: #441869;"><u>Question 3</u>: How does the prevalence of corporate property ownership in student-dense neighborhoods compare with that in other areas?</strong> <br><br>
					<b>Motivation:</b> Boston’s student body isn’t just a statistic—it’s a force that shapes the city. Boston contains roughly 250,000 students spread across more than 50 colleges and universities. When I arrived in September, I was struck by how the academic spirit permeated every corner of the city. Whether I found myself in a café, park, or restaurant, groups of young people—mostly in their early twenties—were deep in intellectual conversation. While searching for a place to live as a graduate student, I quickly discovered that the rising rents in Cambridge were too high a barrier for me to cross. I ended up in Somerville—a choice that meant a longer commute but was one of the few affordable alternatives. This experience led me to ponder: To what extent is the thriving student culture being reshaped by the rise in rents driven by corporate ownership of property?

				<li><strong style="color: #441869;"><u>Question 4</u>: How do vacancy rates in Boston differ across wealth strata?</strong>
					<br><br>
					<b>Motivation:</b> In the Boston Globe article “<i>Reckoning with Boston’s Towers of Wealth</i>,” the authors paint a vivid picture of the city’s economic duality. They describe picnickers on the Christian Science Plaza lawn noticing that most windows of Four Seasons One Dalton are dark—a subtle yet striking hint that those who own the property may not be living there. In fact, the article mentions that only 16 percent of the units in the Four Seasons One Dalton have owners who claim them as their primary homes through a residential tax exemption. The implication is clear: many of these units are likely held for speculative profit rather than lived in. This stands in stark contrast to the everyday reality for many low-income residents, who are increasingly priced out of the housing market. Meanwhile, opulent amenities—like a wellness spa for “Very Important Pets”—signal a luxury lifestyle that is rapidly becoming the norm in certain parts of the city. Against this backdrop, we ask how the vacancy rates in Boston vary across different wealth strata.

				<b><u>Summary</u>:</b> We will examine four facets of Boston’s housing market by exploring different aspects of our dataset. We will track Somerville’s corporate investment in residential properties from 2004 to 2024 (Question 1), investigate which home types corporate speculators target (Question 2), explore how corporate ownership shapes student-dense neighborhoods (Question 3), and analyze vacancy rates across different wealth levels (Question 4). Drawing on four diverse data sources and two personal experiences, we will begin to reveal how profit-driven real estate transforms communities.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			Our first question concerns the percentage of residential properties that were purchased by corporate 
			investors in Somerville (from 2004 to 2024). We will use the following dataset for our analysis: <i>Change Over 
			Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</i>. This dataset
			contains information on the percentage of residential properties that were purchased by corporate investors, by year and neighborhood.
			It is important to note a flag raised in the metadata section of the dataset: they determine corporate ownership
			based on keyphrase matching on the 'owner name' field. This introduces some level of "fuzziness" because of potential
			misclassifications (ie. a residential owner files under a corporation or other misclassifications).
			<br><br>
			Before grouping our data by neighborhood, we will begin with a sanity check. Is it true that (average) corporate ownership has increased
			from 2004?
