			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong style="color: #441869;"><u>Question 1</u>: In Fenway, how has the percentage of residential properties that were purchased by a corporate investor changed from 2004 to 2024? How does this rate compare with other areas in Greater Boston?</strong>
					<br><br>
					<b>Motivation:</b> My long-time family friends have lived in Fenway their entire lives, and we visited them every year for Thanksgiving. In 2016, they were forced to move from their single-family home to a condo due to rising rent prices. They believe these increases were driven by profit-seeking corporations that purchased nearby properties, contributing to rising housing costs. The move was particularly devastating for them, as their home held deep sentimental value—it was where they had raised their children.
					<br><br>
					The "<i>Homes for Profit</i>" article by the MAPC highlights a concerning trend: the rate of residential investor activity has steadily increased, rising from 16% in 2004 to 23% in 2018. This makes me wonder whether my family friends in Fenway experienced greater housing displacement compared to residents in other areas of Greater Boston. The MAPC article offered an analysis by housing submarket, but I am interested in Fenway in particular.

				<li><strong style="color: #441869;"><u>Question 2</u>: </b>What types of houses have been targeted for speculation by different types of corporate sellers (ie. banks, LLCs, LLPs, trust-like entities)?</strong>
					<br><br>
					<b>Motivation:</b>  The article <i>"When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord"</i> highlights private equity firms as the most aggressive corporate speculators, noting that the most aggressive funds aim for profits of 20% or more on investors’ contributions, minus management fees. In contrast, publicly traded real estate trusts yield a dividend of just 4.33%. Given this significant difference in profit expectations, I am curious whether there is also a meaningful difference in the types of homes targeted for speculation by these corporations. This question is important because different types of homes are purchased by people from different wealth brackets and socioeconomic groups, meaning corporate speculation could disproportionately impact certain communities.

				<li><strong style="color: #441869;"><u>Question 3</u>: How does the prevalence of corporate property ownership in student-dense neighborhoods compare with that in other areas?</strong> <br><br>
					<b>Motivation:</b> Boston’s student body isn’t just a statistic—it’s a force that shapes the city. Boston contains roughly 250,000 students spread across more than 50 colleges and universities. When I arrived in September, I was struck by how the academic spirit permeated every corner of the city. Whether I found myself in a café, park, or restaurant, groups of young people—mostly in their early twenties—were deep in intellectual conversation. While searching for a place to live as a graduate student, I quickly discovered that the rising rents in Cambridge were too high a barrier for me to cross. I ended up in Somerville—a choice that meant a longer commute but was one of the few affordable alternatives. This experience led me to ponder: To what extent is the thriving student culture being reshaped by the rise in rents driven by corporate ownership of property?

				<hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgb(244, 221, 224);"><br>
				<li><strong style="color: #441869;"><u>Question 4</u>: How do vacancy rates in Boston differ across wealth strata?</strong>
					<br><br>
					<b>Motivation:</b> In the Boston Globe article “<i>Reckoning with Boston’s Towers of Wealth</i>,” the authors paint a vivid picture of the city’s economic duality. They describe picnickers on the Christian Science Plaza lawn noticing that most windows of Four Seasons One Dalton are dark—a subtle yet striking hint that those who own the property may not be living there. In fact, the article mentions that only 16 percent of the units in the Four Seasons One Dalton have owners who claim them as their primary homes through a residential tax exemption. The implication is clear: many of these units are likely held for speculative profit rather than lived in. This stands in stark contrast to the everyday reality for many low-income residents, who are increasingly priced out of the housing market. Meanwhile, opulent amenities—like a wellness spa for “Very Important Pets”—signal a luxury lifestyle that is rapidly becoming the norm in certain parts of the city. Against this backdrop, we ask how the vacancy rates in Boston vary across different wealth strata.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			Our first question concerns the percentage of residential properties that were purchased by corporate 
			investors in Fenway (from 2004 to 2024). We will use the following dataset for our analysis: <i>Change Over 
			Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</i>. This dataset
			contains information on the percentage of residential properties that were purchased by corporate investors, by year and neighborhood.
			It is important to note a flag raised in the metadata section of the dataset: they determine corporate ownership
			based on keyphrase matching on the 'owner name' field. This introduces some level of "fuzziness" because of potential
			misclassifications (ie. a residential owner files under a corporation).
			<br><br>
			Before grouping our data by neighborhood, we will begin with a sanity check. Is it true that (average) corporate ownership has increased
			from 2004 to 2024? We will plot the average corporate ownership rate (averaged over all neighborhoods) over time to confirm this trend.

			<figure style="overflow: auto; text-align: left;">
				<img src="A2_2.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				Average corporate ownership rates steadily increase from 2004 (5.48%) to 2024 (25.29%). To calculate this average, each neighborhood and year was given equal weight. 
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the following dataset: <i>Change Over Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</i>.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We find that indeed, corporate ownership rates steadily increase over our desired time frame. We see that 
			rates almost monotonically increased from 5.48% in 2004 to 25.29% in 2024. This is in line with our initial assumption. Now,
			we are ready to move on to our main question: how does Fenway compare to other areas in Greater Boston? 
			<br><br>
			To facilitate the ease of our analysis, we will group our data by neighborhood and year. We will then plot the corporate ownership rates for Fenway and other
			areas in Greater Boston over time. By preserving the structure of the previous figure (including axes and data dimensions) and altering only the data grouping, we make it easy for readers to compare the aggregated and grouped results between Figure 1 and Figure 2.
			

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_3.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				This figure shows how average corporate ownership rates (grouped by neighborhood) change from 2004 to 2024. We highlight the trend of Fenway in green and the trends
				of all other considered neighbhoods in grey. The corporate ownership rates in Fenway are consistently higher than the average corporate ownership rates across all neighborhoods.
				Note that a random half of the original neighborhoods were removed from this figure to reduce clutter. We ensured that no removed neighbhorhood had consistently higher average corporate ownership rates
				than Fenway.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the following dataset: <i>Change Over Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</i>.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			The results demonstrate a clear trend. The corporate ownership rates in Fenway (9.00% in 2004 to 36.00% in 2024) are consistently higher than the average corporate ownership rates across 
			all neighborhoods. This is illustrated by the height of the green line (which corresponds to Fenway) relative to the grey lines (which correspond to each of the other neighborhoods).
			This suggests that Fenway residents may have experienced greater housing displacement compared to 
			residents in other areas of Greater Boston. This is in line with the concerns raised by my family friends, who 
			believe that rising rent prices in Fenway were driven by profit-seeking corporations. The results of our analysis 
			provide quantitative support for their anecdotal observations.
			<br><br>
			As my family friends are immigrants from Slovenia and Cyprus, this analysis raised another question: how did the demographic
			breakup of Fenway change over the years? Consulting the same dataset, we created pie charts to visualize the demographic breakdown of Fenway 
			in three equally-spaced years: 2004, 2014, and 2024. Our result surprised us, indicating an error in our assumptions about the dataset.

			<figure>
				<img src="A2_4.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				Pie charts demonstrate the demographic breakdown of Fenway in 2004, 2014, and 2024. These pie charts reveal a 
				strange finding: all of the population values by demographic group were equal across the years.
				This raised a red flag that our analysis may be incorrect. After consulting the metadata section of 
				the dataset, we noticed the root of our error: the demographic information
				in our dataset was for the year 2020, despite the fact that this demographic information was 
				included separately for each year. Note that the following information is missing from the pie-chart: the
				hispanic population size was 3,643 in each year (it was omitted to reduce clutter).
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the following dataset: <i>Change Over Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</i>.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			As stated in the figure caption, this analysis revealed an incorrect assumption that we made. 
			Each pie chart (for 2004, 2014, and 2024) was identical, suggesting the very unlikely 
			possibility that demographic breakdown of Fenway remained consistent across the years. 
			This raised a red flag that our initial assumptions about the dataset may be incorrect. After consulting the metadata 
			section of the dataset, we noticed the root of our error: the demographic information in 
			our dataset was for the year 2020, despite the fact that this demographic information was 
			included separately for each year. This error highlights the importance of carefully 
			reading the metadata section of a dataset before proceeding with analysis.
			<br><br>
			As a result, we were unable to answer our original question about how the demographic breakdown of Fenway
			changed over the years. However, we were able to pivot our analysis and ask a different question:
			in the year of 2020, how did the demographic breakdown of Fenway compare to other areas in Greater Boston?


			<figure>
				<img src="A2_5.png" alt="" style="width:100%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				This figure plots the demographic breakdown of Fenway and six random other neighborhoods from the Greater
				Boston area in 2020. In Fenway, shown in the middle of the figure, the white population is the largest demographic group, followed by the AAPI population.
				Allston, Downtown, North End, and South Boston were all predominantly white, while Chinatown was primarily AAPI, and Mattapan was primarily black.
				<br><br>This information was sourced from the following dataset: <i>Change Over Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</i>.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Our analysis revealed that in Fenway, the white population was the largest demographic group, followed by the AAPI 
			population. This is in line with the demographic breakdown of other neighborhoods in the Greater Boston area. 
			Allston, Downtown, North End, and South Boston were all predominantly white, while Chinatown was primarily AAPI, 
			and Mattapan was primarily black. This analysis provides a snapshot of the demographic makeup of Fenway and other
			 neighborhoods in Greater Boston in the year 2020. It is important to note that <i>given the constraints of the dataset</i>, this analysis is limited to the
			 year 2020 and does not capture changes in the demographic breakdown over time.	

			<br><br>
			We conclude that while Fenway has a higher rate of corporate ownership compared to other areas in Greater Boston, it is 
			not the case that Fenway is disproportionately populated with minority residents. However, our analysis does not
			eliminate the possibility that corporate ownership in Fenway has disproportionately impacted the minority residents
			within the Fenway neighborhood. This is an important area for future research.

			<br><br>
			Our second question concerns the types of houses targeted for speculation by different types of corporate sellers. 
			We will use the following dataset for our analysis:

			<br><br>
			Again, we begin with sanity checks and summary statistics about our dataset.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>We examined four facets of Boston’s housing market by exploring different aspects of our dataset.</p>
			<p> First, we explored how the rate of corporate ownership in Fenway increase frim 2004 to 2024. In
				aggregate, we showed that average corporate ownership rates across the wider Greater Boston area
				steadily increase across our time frame.
			</p>
			<p>First, we examined the trajectory of corporate ownership in Fenway from 2004 to 2024. Our analysis 
				confirmed that corporate ownership (on average) across Boston increased steadily—from an average 
				of 5.48% in 2004 to 25.29% in 2024—while Fenway consistently exhibited significantly higher 
				rates, rising from 9.00% in 2004 to 36.00% in 2024. These findings support our hypothesis that 
				profit-driven real estate activities may be contributing to greater housing displacement in 
				Fenway compared to other neighborhoods. Our analysis of the demographic breakdown of Fenway
				in 2020 showed that the population was mostly white, although we note that this does not 
				eliminate the possibility that the minority residents were most affected by increases in the rate
				of corporate ownership. Such an analysis would require more longitudinal data about Fenway, which
				was outside of the single-year scope of our census dataset.
			</p>

			<p> Second, we investigated the types of homes targeted for speculation by different types of corporate sellers.</p>
			<p> Third, we explored how the prevalence of corporate property ownership in student-dense neighborhoods compared with other areas.</p>
			<p> Fourth, we analyzed how vacancy rates in Boston differ across wealth strata.</p>
			<p>Profit-driven real estate transforms communities.</p>
